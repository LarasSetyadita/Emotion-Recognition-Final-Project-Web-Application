        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600">
            Research by Gross (2002) in his article "Emotion Regulation: Affective, Cognitive, and Social Consequences"
            shows that effective emotion regulation is associated with better psychological well-being, while the inability
            to manage emotions can increase the risk of anxiety and depression disorders.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600">
            Emotions play a significant role in human behavior. Proper emotional regulation helps individuals navigate their daily lives and interactions, promoting healthier relationships and decision-making processes.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600">
            Understanding emotions and their regulation is not only important in personal life but also in creating empathetic, supportive environments, whether in families, workplaces, or societies.
